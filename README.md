[Download the release](https://github.com/tma02/spotispy/releases), unzip the file, and run the app or exe.

Due to limitations in the Spotify API, the max album art size is 600x600.

### Multiple monitors?
You can switch between your displays with ```Cmd+Shift+Arrow``` or ```Ctrl+Shift+Arrow``` on Windows.

### Developers
